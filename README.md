# Csharp-NoteTaking-App
Made Using Winforms

On Launch Just Hit Continue And It Will Create The Files It Needs However You Can Also Just Make a text file called notes.txt where ever the exe file it located
ps might need admin to make the files i dont think it does but still might have not done any testing on using non admin users

This Also as the ability to set reminders but only one at a time and for the base of this app because i made this for the point of learning i did look about how to make one online and i used a few tutorials/examples i did add a some a fetures to the app like the reminder system and the ability to search notes along with a few other things and also changed some of the base code to work with some of the stuff that i added tho not a by a whole lot i will search around to find the stuff that i used to make the base of the app and try to give credit however it might take awhile to find it however if you choose to use this please give credit to me as the one that added to the app and once i find the thing i used to make the base of the app please credit them as the one who made the base of the app i choose not to put this under any licenses becouse i was not the one who made the base of the app and it would not feel right and possibly not legal however i do not thing that uploading this now that you have benn givin the context is a bad thing to do, sincerly Z&E-Dev, ps for anyone who wants to use this code to add on to it for adding more reminders have a int that goes up every time the user hits set reminder and then have that be something like an identifer to a frm so like you would hit new reminder and then it would make a new frm and because the int went up one it the next time the user presses set reminder it would creat a new frm with a different name for the seprate reminder, also there is a small glich that is when you search for notes made and there it nothing under the seach you would just have to double click on the empty space that the datagridview hase however after doing that it makes creats a empty note to my knowedge its because  you would need to have editing = false every time you click set reminder and if that does not work then you could just remove the base empty part of the datagridview and after you hit search it chnages the button text to clear search then if the button text = clear search then make the search tag empty for you could use a string on the button click and then else if but eh,

tl:dr: i added a okay amount to the base app however for the base part i looked up how to do it for learning, once i find the place i used to make the made the base app , i will give credit to the place, and it does have one or two small glitches
