# Csharp-NoteTaking-App
Made Using Winforms

On Launch Just Hit Continue And It Will Create The Files It Needs However You Can Also Just Make a text file called notes.txt where ever the exe file it located
ps might need admin to make the files i dont think it does but still might have not done any testing on using non admin users

This Also as the ability to set reminders but only one at a time and for the base of this app because i made this for the point of learning i did look how to make one online and i used Shaun Halverson tutorial on youtube i did add a decent bit of fetures to the app like the reminder system and the ability to search notes along with a some other things and also changed some of the base code to work with some of the stuff that i added tho not a by a huge amount if you choose to use this for anything please give credit to me as the one that added to the extra stuff to the app and Please Full credit To Shaun Halverson on youtube as the person who made the base Note app sincerly Z&E-Dev,

ps for anyone who wants to use this code to add on to it for adding more reminders have something like a int that goes up every time the user hits set reminder and then have that be something like an identifer to a frm so like you would hit new reminder and then it would make a new frm and because the int went up one it the next time the user presses set reminder it would creat a new frm with a different name for the seprate reminder, also there is a small glich that is when you search for notes made and there it nothing under the seach you would just have to double click on the empty space that the datagridview hase however after doing that it makes creats a empty note to my knowedge its because  you would need to have editing = false every time you click set reminder and if that does not work then you could just remove the base empty part of the datagridview and after you hit search it chnages the button text to clear search then if the button text = clear search then make the search tag empty for you could use a string on the button click and then else if but eh,

tl:dr: i added a okay amount to the base app however for the base part i followed Shaun Halverson tutorial on how to do it for learning, and it does have one or two small glitches

Edit: After Searching i Found the place that i used for the base of the app and its 
Shaun Halverson
on youtube i give full credit to that person for making the main base note app i just added a decent bit to it
